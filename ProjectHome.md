### Vidarr Development has Ceased ###
As of Today (June 20 2014), I am ceasing development on Vidarr. It has been quite some time since I had time to work on Vidarr, and really any work on it has ceased in the last two years. I'd be more than happy to pass off the project to someone else if they wanted it.

## What if Vidarr doesn't work on your version of OSX? ##
I haven't even checked whether Vidarr works with anything past Lion, but if it doesn't, you might be able to get it to work yourself if you are willing to put in the time. Download the trial of MaxMSP at [Cycling74](http://cycling74.com) and then download the source code. Re-compile the file into a new program, and it should work. You will also need to include some other files when you compile, these are also available for download in the downloads directory. Spend a weekend looking at the documentation for creating a standalone, and you can probably get it done.

my username followed by @gmail is where you can reach me for any questions, though I will be of limited help at this point forward.

<td><h2>About</h2>Vidarr was developed to work with stations that use <a href='http://radiologik.com'>Radiologik</a>, and thanks to <a href='http://code.google.com/p/soundflower/'>Soundflower</a> compatibility, is ideal for just about any streaming radio station running on a Mac. Say Goodbye to Dead Air!<h2>How it Works</h2> Vidarr listens to a selected audio driver and input, and sends an alert if the volume levels fall below an adjustable threshold for a set amount of time. When the alarm is triggered, Vidarr sends an email, which can also be received as a text message (<a href='http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/email-to-sms/'>See here</a>). It also can execute a UNIX shell commands, making it possible to execute scripts and tie in all sorts of other actions. <h3>User Testimonial:</h3>  <i>"Vidarr is great. It really saves me a lot of worrying, and I recommend it to everyone!"</i><h4>-Lucas McCallister, Creator</h4></td>
